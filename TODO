This is WebSource version 2.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs :

- Update tests

Wishes :

- Build a description on the fly in the command line
- Load/Save network state to disk (in order to stop and restart network)
- Use cleaner enveloppes (all XML/DOM ?)
- File based data sharing
- Convert WebSource 1 descriptions into WebSource 2 descriptions
- Create more source descriptions
- Create a WebSource::Error class to handle errors
- Make query building more flexible
- Complete transformation from dia to wsd allowing graphical
  construction of source descriptions
- Add a WebSource::Queue modules which allows to control the
  order in which values come out using a priority meta-value
- Module composition : define in one file a module m1 and
  be able to use it in another module m2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't hesitate to give me some suggestions


The following things are now done

- Define an easy way to do filtering (by using tests ?)
  => See the module WebSource::Filter::tests

- Create a WebSource::Param class containing shared parameters
  => now wsd files can contain a <ws:options> element which defines
     options which can be passed to this task

     these values can be used by any sub-task by using the
     <ws:set-attribute name="attr-name" value="opt-name" /> element
     which before building the task adds and attribut tp the parent
     not of the ws:set-attribut element using the value of
     opt-name which can be set by passing the appropriate options to
     the ws-query command.
