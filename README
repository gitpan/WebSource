WebSource version 2
===================

WebSource is a framework taking the form of a perl module and allowing
computer access to the Web. It allows to describe a complex task by
decomposing it into simpler small tasks. The complex task is descriped
in an XML file. Each such task is composed of extraction, fetching, 
filtering, querying, formatting subtasks.

For example the task allowing to query google and get the resulting urls is
done with four subtasks : 
  - "query" : building the initial query,
  - "fetch" : fetching the result pages, 
  - "links" : extraction the urls from the results pages, and 
  - "next"  : extracting the next page link to allow the fetching
              of more results.

The result of the "query" task is sent to the "fetch" tasks which downloads
a page it is given and then sends it to both "links" and "next" tasks. The
"next" task extracts the next page url and sends it to "fetch". The "links"
task extraction the resulting url which are returned.

 - LWP::UserAgent    : the World Wide Web perl library
 - XML::LibXML       : the perl interface to the libxml2 library
 - HTML::TreeBuilder : an HTML parser which is robust and alows
                       to generate XML

USAGE 

The most common usage of WebSource is done by using the ws-query
command. A typical call is :

ws-query [options] -s <desc file> <parameters>

where options are ws-query options and parameters are specific to the 
used source description file (<ws:options> element)

More info on the ws-query command can be obtained by calling it with
the -h option ...

$ ws-query -h
